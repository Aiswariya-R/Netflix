# Description

The Netflix Data Analysis project leverages Tableau to develop interactive visualizations and dashboards using the Netflix dataset. It aims to provide comprehensive insights into various aspects of the Netflix library, including content distribution, genres, release dates, and ratings.

Key questions addressed in the project include:

* Which genres are most prevalent in the Netflix library?
* How has the distribution of content evolved over the years?
* Which countries contribute the highest number of Netflix titles?
* What are the average ratings for movies and TV shows on Netflix?
* How does the length of movies and TV shows vary across different genres?
* Which titles have received the highest and lowest ratings from viewers?
  
These visualizations offer a detailed understanding of the trends and patterns within Netflix's extensive content library.
