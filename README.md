# Netflix - Tableau Project

This project explores the Netflix dataset using Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool. The aim is to analyze and visualize various aspects of Netflix's content catalog, providing valuable insights into the streaming platform. By leveraging Tableau's capabilities, we can uncover patterns and trends in the types of content available, release dates, genres, and more. This analysis will help understand the diversity and distribution of Netflix's offerings, aiding in strategic decisions for content curation and user engagement.
